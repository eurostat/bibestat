This framework comprises a list of 35 indicators (EWoC indicators) related to macroeconomics, microeconomics, globalization, environment and socio-institutional aspects. The analytical methods for this study were established in line with the Statistical reference framework for competitiveness analysis in the EU-28 Member States. As a rather broad concept, competitiveness can be described by a large set of different factors and definitions. The aim of this analysis is to show possible redundancy between indicators, but also possible explanatory power. Moreover, it tests the initial assumption that the largest principal components will be sufficient to explain the variability in the observed dataset. Finally, it detects possible patterns based on available set of indicators. Results confirmed some well-known correlations. For instance, the unemployment rate is positively correlated with the indicator People at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE), which is also negatively correlated with the Real GDP per capita. Nevertheless, the performed correlation analysis did not provide any substantial results regarding some other expected correlations. It has to be mentioned at this point that, the presence or the absence of correlation results between several indicators of the set of EWoC indicators, is a fact that should not be understand as a weakness of the EWoC framework but rather as a strength due to the fact that there is not redundant information. Exploring the high correlations between the aforementioned indicators and indicators by themselves, it was decided to control for the indicator 4. Concerning the results obtained with partial correlation analysis, it was evident that most of the previously captured correlation actually comes from the Gross domestic expenditure on R\&D. More precisely, when controlling the correlation for the aforementioned indicator, the correlation across EWoC indicators becomes weaker or insignificant in almost all cases. For that reason, and other reasons detailed in the article, indicator 4 was not used for the latter analysis. Finally, the correlation analysis showed that indicator 34: Control of corruption could be also removed from the set of the EWoC indicators. The cross-correlation analysis explored time series correlation and showed that for the same pair of indicators, different or opposite correlation results can be obtained. This proved that countries may react differently and in several periods in time, to similar economic changes. This result provided the idea of countries clustering. In addition, obtained correlation coefficients vary from country to country. Therefore, it was of interest to look for the evidence of formation of groups of countries. In another words, the country-clusters. EU-28The performed analysis showed that the "old" EU Member States (France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy...) form a cluster while the Eastern EU countries, i.e. "newest"Member States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia...) form a separate cluster. It is also noteworthy the fact that Luxembourg stands out as being very different, insofar as it forms its own cluster (Figure 1). The explored dataset consists of 29 indicators for time span 2000-2014. Therefore, it seemed logic to examine opportunities for the reduction of dimensionality or indicators` grouping. All analysis (Principal Components, k-means cluster analysis and Gaussian mixture model and the Hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis) showed that indicators, either as a component of one linear combination or as a member of one group, can be classified into 4 groups. It is noteworthy the fact that indicator 29: Real GDP per capita stands out as being different, insofar as it forms its own cluster","","","",""

The ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment address the need for harmonisation expressed on several occasions by many users such as the European Central Bank (ECB), European Commission services, and the ECOFIN Council. The definition of best practices in the field of seasonal adjustment has been long debated at European level. Since 2007, the Seasonal Adjustment Steering Group co-chaired by Eurostat and the ECB gave a new and crucial input to the compilation of the first edition of the guidelines, published in 2009. The first edition has been widely accepted and implemented. However, taking into account the experience accumulated since 2009 and the need to further clarify some specific aspects, in 2012 the Seasonal Adjustment Steering Group decided to launch a revision of the guidelines. The ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment are the outcome of the revision work and the ESS Committee (ESSC) endorsed them in November 2014. The revised ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment present both theoretical aspects and practical implementation issues in a friendly and easy to read framework, thereby addressing both experts and non- experts in seasonal adjustment. They meet the requirement of principle 7 (Sound Methodology) of the European Statistics Code of Practice and their implementation will also be in line with principles 14 (Coherence and Comparability) and 15 (Accessibility and Clarity). The guidelines also foster the transparency of seasonal adjustment practices by encouraging the documentation of all seasonal adjustment steps and the dissemination of seasonal adjustment practices by means of the metadata template for seasonal adjustment. Finally they allow for development of expertise and capacity building. The revised version of the guidelines includes a new section with a policy for seasonal adjustment, making the revised version of the guidelines consistent with the guidelines on revisions policies. It also better describes the different steps in seasonal adjustment. Finally the specification of alternatives has been reviewed, making them more operational.","","","",""

Direct measures of indicators at a high frequency can be very costly and difficult to achieve sometimes resulting in low quality results when the information set is not adequate. In such situations temporal disaggregation techniques can constitute a feasible alternative to the direct estimation of high frequency indicators. Additionally, even when high frequency indicators can be directly compiled, they are often not consistent over time with lower frequency versions. For example, annual surveys with larger samples may give more accurate estimates of the level of a variable compared to estimates from a small monthly survey that is designed to provide estimates of monthly change. Under the hypothesis that low frequency indicators are more reliable than high frequency ones, benchmarking techniques can be used to ensure the time consistency between high and low frequency indicators. Finally, directly or indirectly measured high frequency indicators may not necessarily meet required accounting and aggregation constraints. If that low frequency indicators meet accounting and aggregation constraints, reconciliation techniques can be used to restore them on high frequency indicators too. Eurostat and the European Statistical System (ESS) developed these guidelines to help data producers derive high frequency data (e.g. quarterly or monthly) from low frequency data (e.g. annual) and to address related temporal and accounting constraints. Typical applications are known as temporal disaggregation, benchmarking, and reconciliation. The guidelines identify best practice to: (i) achieve harmonization across national processes; (ii) enhance comparability between results; (iii) ensure consistency across domains and between aggregates and their components. The establishment of common guidelines for temporal disaggregation within the European Statistical System (ESS) is an essential step towards better harmonization and comparability of official statistics, especially in macroeconomic indicators and labour market statistics. These guidelines address the need for harmonization expressed by users from European and National Institutions. This document presents both theoretical aspects and practical implementation issues in a user friendly and easy to read framework. They meet the requirement of principle 7 (Sound Methodology) of the European Statistics Code of Practice (CoP), and their implementation is consistent with principles 14 (Coherence and Comparability) and 15 (Accessibility and Clarity). The guidelines also provide transparency of temporal disaggregation, benchmarking and reconciliation practices by encouraging documentation and dissemination of practices. These guidelines are complementary to the ESS guidelines on seasonal adjustment (Eurostat, 2015 edition), the ESS guidelines on revision policy for PEEIs (Eurostat, 2013 edition), and the Eurostat and United Nations handbook on rapid estimates. They are also in line with the Handbook on quarterly national accounts (Eurostat, 2013 edition).","","","",""

The system does this by showing when the estimates are sufficiently reliable to be published, either with or without a warning. It is based on: (i) coefficients of variations for totals and means of continuous variables; (ii) standard errors for proportions and counts. This paper also presents the work carried out to harmonise variance estimation methods and their application within the ESS. To apply the new quality rating system consistently, Eurostat and the national statistical bodies must compute roughly the same variance estimates. Future structural farm statistics will come from the data collected from 'Integrated Farm Statistics', based on a modular approach. This will lead to more complex national sampling designs. The paper also outlines ongoing developments towards integrating additional sampling design information specific to national multi-stage sampling in the estimation of variance. The paper also introduces new quality reporting based on the European Standard Quality Reporting System (ESQRS) template. This is of great help in assessing all quality dimensions, thereby improving the quality of EU data and metadata. Farm structure surveys are the main source of information on the current state of agriculture and the trends it is undergoing, required to monitor the common agricultural policy and other EU policies. High-quality data are essential for decision-makers.","","","",""

Beyond just devising guidelines and best practices, we show how the platform is implemented for the production of social statistics. For that purpose, we adopt a reasonable mix of bottom-up (from low-level scope to high-level vision) and top-down (from black-box process models to traceable functional modules) designs, so as to "think global, [and] act local".

From the analyst's perspective, the most informative data are possibly located within the end-series observations.

First, prices are aggregated without weights at the elementary level. Prices are typically obtained from dedicated surveys for which price collectors visit outlets  and  record  the  observed  prices.  These  elementary  price  indices  are  then  aggregated  to  the  higher  levels using expenditure weights.  Nowadays,  CPIs  are  becoming  a  multi-source  statistics  where  prices  are  obtained  not  only  from  price  collection  in  the  field  but  also  from  transaction  data,  administrative  data  or  from  the  Internet  using  web  scraping techniques. Depending on the data source, different strategies can be adopted for constructing the elementary aggregates and for compiling elementary price indices. A CPI may be compiled in more than two stages and weights may be available even within the elementary aggregates. With scanner data, the index compiler must make two main structural decisions which can have a significant impact on inflation measurement. First, the item which is being aggregated must be defined. Second, the level must be fixed up to which these items are first aggregated. To discuss this second issue, we distinguish two strategies for a category that can be divided into sub-categories. Either the items are directly aggregated to the category level, possibly using a multilateral method. Alternatively, the multilateral method aggregates only up to the sub-category level, and these intermediate sub-category level indices are then aggregated to the  category  level  using  for  instance  a  Laspeyres-type  index  formula.  The  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  examine the impact of introducing this additional level of fixity in the CPI structure.","","","",""

International Conference on Agricultural Statistics","","","","","","","","","","","","Many important policies of the European Union, such as the Common Agricultural Policy, depend on agricultural statistics. These statistics need to be of high quality, coherent, comparable and flexible, and should be produced efficiently based on users' needs in order to best serve evidence-based policy making and monitoring. The current EU agricultural statistics system does not fulfil these requirements well enough. To address this, Eurostat launched the "New legislation on Agricultural Statistics for a strategy towards 2020 and beyond" initiative in 2014. It aims to introduce two new legal frameworks stepwise: an"Integrated Farm Statistics" Regulation which will provide the basis for collecting farm level micro-data, based on a modular approach with core, module and ad hoc surveys; and a "Statistics on Agricultural Input/Output" Regulation which will provide aggregated statistics in tabular form. These frameworks will contain basic elements such as scope, precision and quality requirements and will use common definitions and classifications, while more technical elements will be covered by secondary legislation. EU Member States will be free to choose data sources, including administrative and other new data sources. This paper presents the Strategy for agricultural statistics 2020 and beyond and shows its suitability to meet technical and methodological requirements as well as to successfully navigate the complex institutional, legal and political context within the European Union and its 28 Member States. It can therefore serve as an instructive example for a cross-border implementation of the United Nations Global Strategy to improve agricultural and rural Statistics.","","","",""

New Techniques and Technologies for Statistics (NTTS)","","","","","","","","","","","","A flag is an attribute of a cell in a data set that provides additional qualitative information about the statistical value of that cell. They can indicate a wide range of information, for example, that a given value is estimated, confidential or represents a break in the time series. Currently different sets of flags are in use in the European Statistical System (ESS). Some statistical domains use the SDMX code list for observation status and confidentiality status, OECD uses a simplified version of the SDMX code lists and Eurostat uses a short list of flags for dissemination which combines the observation and confidentiality status. While in most cases it is well defined how a flag shall be assigned to an individual value, it is not straightforward to decide what flag shall be propagated to aggregated values like a sum, an average, quantiles, etc. This topic is important for Eurostat as the European aggregates are derived from national data points. Thus the information contained in the individual flags need to be summarized in a flag for the aggregate. This issue is not unique to Eurostat, but can occur for any aggregated data. For example, a national statistical institute may derive the national aggregate from regional data sets. In addition, the dissemination process provides further peculiarity: only a limited set of flags, compared to the set of flags used in the production process, can be applied in order to make it easily understandable to the users. In the scientific community there is a wide range of research about the consequences of data aggregation but it concentrates only on the information loss during aggregation of information and there is no scientific guidance how to aggregate flags. This paper is an attempt to provide a picture about the current situation and provide some systematic guidance how to aggregate flags in a coherent way. Eurostat is testing various approaches with a view to well balance transparency and clarity of the information made available to users in a flag. From several options, 3 methods (hierarchical, frequency and weighted frequency) are implemented in an R package for assigning a flag to an aggregate based on the underlying flags and values. Since the topic has relevance outside of Eurostat as well, it was decided to publish the respective code with documentation with a view to foster re-use within the European Statistical System and to stimulate discussion, including with the user community.","","","",""

There is also a  recognised effort made by trade statisticians for mitigate trade asymmetry over time. Notwithstanding the positive achievements that have been made so far, to build an Inter-Country Supply, Use and Input-Output tables (IC-SUIOT) we more than low trade asymmetry: we need no trade asymmetry at all. The European Statistical System (ESS) has an extensive and rich amount of trade data and a lot of resources are devoted to measure trade flows. Nevertheless, the customs union of the EU adds another challenge regarding trade in goods statistics: Member-States declare imports/exports for customs or tax purposes without thisMember State having acquired ownership of the goods,  i.e. declare quasi-transit as well. While relevant  for physical  flow of  trade, quasi-transit and re-exports distort the geographical economic relationship among Member-States and therefore they should be identified and taken into account in the framework of IC-SUIOT. QDR methodology was developed in order to address the specificities of trade in goods in EU by providing a way to estimate  consolidated trade flows, i.e. solving trade asymmetries, between two countries by three types of trade: quasi-transit (Q), domestic (D) and re-export (R). For quasi-transit and re-exports the intermediary country between that takes part of the physical  flow between origin and destination is also identified. QDR methodology was used in FIGARO project and it revealed very useful for identifying  relevant trade relationships within countries.","","","",""

The QALI values by EU Member State are weighted by skills,  by age and by combinations of skill and age groups. The industry breakdown varies depending on countries due to reliability/confidentiality constraints of the survey data: 21 industries (A21) for some countries, EU28 and EA19; 10 industries (A10); and the total economy. Connected to the decomposition of the volume by type of workers (by age and by skill), the results will give interesting insights on what kind of employment is supported by European exports in terms of age, qualifications,  and in which industrial activities.

International Statistical Institute (ISI) World Statistics Congress","","","","","","","","","","","","The  availability of new digital data sources represents an opportunity for Statistical  Offices (SO) to complement traditional statistics and/or deliver novel statistics with improved timeliness and relevance. Nowadays SOs are  part of a larger "data ecosystem" where different organizations, including public institutions and private companies, engage in  the collection and processing of different kinds of (new) data about citizens, companies, goods etc.  In this multi-actors scenario it is often desirable to let one organization extract some output statistics (i.e., aggregate information) from input data that are held by other organization(s) in different administrative domain(s). We refer to this problem as cross-domain statistical processing. To achieve this goal, the most intuitive approach - but not the only one - is  to exchange raw input data across administrative domains (organizations). However, this  strategy is not always viable when personal input data are involved, due to a combination of regulatory constraints (including lack of explicit legal basis for data sharing), business confidentiality, privacy  requirements, or a combination of the above. Furthermore, new data sources often embed a much more pervasive view about individuals than traditional survey and/or administrative data, an aspect that amplifies the potential risks of data concentration. In such cases, performing cross-domain  statistical processing requires technologies to elicit only the agreed-upon output information (exactly or approximately) without revealing the input data. This entails addressing two  distinct but complementary problems. First, we need to compute the desired output statistics without seeing the raw input data. Second, we need to control the amount of information that might be inferred about individual data subjects in the input dataset from the output. In the field of privacy engineering the notions of "input privacy" and "output privacy" are used to refer respectively to these two problems. We remark that these problems are separable, i.e., they can be addressed with distinct tools and methods that get combined together, overlaid or juxtaposed. In this contribution we review recent advances in  both fields and briefly discuss their complementary roles. As for input privacy, we provide a brief introduction to the fundamental principles of Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). As for output privacy, we review recent advances in the field of Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC). Finally, we discuss possible scenarios for SMPC and SDC integration in the future "confidentiality engineering" setup of modern official statistics.","","","",""

This enables statisticians to gain more accurate and up-to-date insight into various aspects of human mobility and related socio-economic phenomena (e.g., tourism flows, presence and residence, commuting patterns, use of transportation means among others) with clear advantages for the process of policy design and evaluation based on such statistics.The cooperation between SO and MNO can be designed to prevent potential conflicts  between the  public and  private interests, e.g. by the provision of adequate protection for business  confidentiality, methodological quality  and process transparency. We argue that partnering with SO brings direct and indirect benefits also to the MNOs, particularly in terms of empowering the portfolio of commercial analytic products they can offer to business customers. Synergies between the production of official statistics and commercial analytic products can be positively leveraged within the framework of a well-designed partnership model. By doing so, the SO-MNO partnership does not represent as a risk to the MNO business nor a diminution of the role and independency of SO, but rather as an additional opportunity for both sides. While the focus of this paper is on partnership models between SOs and MNOs, many elements of the discussion apply as well to private data holders from other sectors, and may contribute to advance the future vision of public-private partnerships for joint data analytics.","","","",""

However, their format and semantic are intimately connected with network-specific technical aspects. For this reason, such data are considerably more complex and have a higher degree of heterogeneity across different Mobile Network Operators (MNO). It is difficult for experts outside the telecommunication domains, such as e.g. statisticians, to interpret and manipulate such data directly. In the proposed contribution we present a general Reference Methodological Framework (RMF) intended to facilitate the use of signalling data by statisticians. The RMF is inspired by the principles of functional layering and by the "hour-glass model", which lie at the foundation of modern computer network architectures. The RMF encompasses a convergence layer that decouples the complexity of signalling data at the bottom from the statistical definitions on the top. This allows experts from the two domains, MNO engineers and statisticians, to work independently and eases the evolution of the two layers.This paper presents the general principles underlying the RMF, the role and responsibilities of the different actors in transforming elemental data into meaningful and relevant statistical concepts, provides a concrete actionable proposal and presents early results from its application in a pilot project conducted in collaboration between Eurostat and one European MNO. We highlight lessons learned and give an outlook for the future development and implementation of the RMF and its application to tourism statistics and other areas of statistics.","","","",""

Although at EU level, balance of payments statisticians and trade in services statisticians follow up regularly on the asymmetries and try to reduce  them, we needed to implement a methodology for compiling a balanced view of trade in services as an input to the EU inter-country supply, use and input-output tables.For  the  first  release of FIGARO tables for the year 2010, the 2010  international  trade in services data (ITSS) serves as the  primary input.  Their exports and imports (or mirror exports)  are subsequently cleaned, imputed, estimated, modelled and confronted with Balance of Payments data to get a full dataset for 29 countries (EU Member States plus USA), 30 partner countries (plus RoW) and a number of services items.  The balancing of the resulting exports and import  values to solve the bilateral trade asymmetries is based on the methodology   developed   by   the   European Commission and  the OECD. As the EU inter-country supply, use and input-output tables present economies using the activity and product classification, the last step is to bridge the balanced trade view of the data from services categories to product classification (CPA/CPC). The paper  summarises the steps as compiled for the 2010 tables and shows the way foreseen to improve the compilation steps for the time series  2010-2016.

Quality conference","","","","","","","","","","","","Statistical authorities need to produce data faster in a cost effective way, to become more responsive to users' demands, while at the same time providing high quality output. One way to fulfil this is to make more use of already available data sources, and in particular administrative sources, most typically used in combination with other sources. Depending on the use of the administrative sources and the data configuration different statistical tasks must be applied. Usually it is not only one task but a sequence of different tasks that have to be applied, for example, data integration, imputation and editing or tabulation. For these tasks different methods are available and depending on the input data quality and the data configuration the same method can have limited use or produce lower quality outputs. The use of administrative data sources risks impacting negatively quality on several dimensions, in particular accuracy and comparability. Surveys and administrative sources have both particular strengths and weaknesses. Combining them may overcome these weaknesses, provided that suitable methodology and tools are used. At the same time, harmonised measures of quality for outputs that combine administrative sources with other sources (surveys) are necessary to ensure that European Union official statistics are of sufficient quality and fit for their intended use. This paper looks at the most frequent methodological challenges faced when integrating administrative sources and provides, for typical situations, preferred methods to have the best quality of statistical output. It also introduces the work of ESSnet on the Quality of Multisource Statistics (KOMUSO) to develop quality measures and guidelines related to the use of administrative sources.","","","",""

It could also be the other way round, splitting national SUTs imports by countries of origin, as in the WIOD approach. The two approaches should not differ, in principle, as long as the view of bilateral  trade among countries is balanced at the level of each good and service and both exports and imports are valued in FOB. However, this is not the case in official statistics, mostly due to trade asymmetries and the different valuation of exports (FOB) and imports (CIF). This  paper however justifies the  first choice for various reasons and put a special focus on the treatment of goods sent  abroad  for processing, including some indications about the necessary assumptions made in the absence of official data about trading partners and type and destination of the processed goods.","","","",""

The rationale is that the seasonal frequencies are different from the frequencies of the cycles, then seasonal movements do not carry useful information, moreover they can hide the information on the frequencies of interest in business cycle analysis. This idea is coherent with the literature on SA that rests on the hypothesis of orthogonality among the seasonal and the others components. For several reasons this hypothesis can fail and an interaction between seasonal and business cycles can arise. This work address the plausibility of this hypothesis and a first study on the effect that different seasonal adjustment algorithms can have on the business cycle analysis due to their different ability in separating the seasonal from the other frequencies. Empirically the evidence or the presence of interactions can be hardly detectable. There are several reasons: components are unobservable as well as their connections, consequently. Moreover, the series are often characterized by instability, and/or evolutionary behaviour of the components. Aim of this work can be summarized in: empirical investigation of the effects of a variety of SA methods on two aspects: the cyclical shape of the series and the turning point dating. The focus is on the growth cycle. The approach will be historical, and then no real time exercises is run.","","","",""

This is due both to technical reasons such as the properties of the symmetric filters used and to non-technical ones such as the fact that, over a sufficiently long time period, components can be better identified and separated; consequently, the seasonal component can be more precisely estimated and eventually removed. In addition, long time series are required in order to read properly the statistics of the seasonality tests. Furthermore, on short time series the seasonality tests might be less robust. In official statistics, available time series associated to statistical indicators are often relatively short or subject to some shortening processes. This seems to contradict one of the main quality dimensions of statistics which is the coverage, but, at the same time, official statistics need to be continuously improved to better reflect the socio-economic structure. This process unavoidably leads to regularly adapting existing official statistics to evolving socio-economic structure. Furthermore better reflecting the current socio-economic situation can also require the development and the statistical compilation of new indicators, which at least in a first phase will cover only a limited time span. These two processes imply, at least temporarily, the availability of short time series associated to the statistical indicators.","","","",""

The usual approach for measuring the quality of the statistical output is to assess quality through the measurement of the input and process quality.

They have developed into a very useful tool for de-tailed analyses and have become the basis for important decisions in the allocation of EU funding. Gradually, the scope of regional statistics has widened, and re-gional statistics now play a role in several statistical domains with a wide range of statistical indicators. The recognition that many of the social and economic issues Europe faces today have urban or rural characteristics has led to an initiative to supplement statistical da-ta on NUTS regions with data on cities and rural areas. These sub-national statistics allow policy makers to better target their policies. For example, in some parts of Eu-rope, poverty and social exclusion are clear-ly an urban problem, while in other areas they are primarily a rural problem. A further aspect that has gained considera-ble importance in territorial policy making - as well as in public awareness - concerns the so-called functional regions, which are selected or constructed from more detailed geographical units according to specific features. The labour market area is one ex-ample of this type of functional delinea-tion, which helps to shed light on im-portant territorial characteristics. The fast-growing use of geographic in-formation and new technical facilities has created possibilities for merging statistics and related geographical information into so-called spatial statistics. An example is grid-based population data, which helps to determine the concrete locations of peo-ple with access to certain facilities (e.g. public transport, airports) or to identify a population close to the sea. Through the intensive use of map-related functions, the utility of regional and urban statistics can also be enhanced, and different statistics can be combined. This paper argues that different sub-national statistics offer different but inter-related perspectives. They can be com-bined in multiple ways to create new pos-sibilities for policy analysis and to illus-trate social and economic characteristics at varying levels of geographic detail.","","","",""

The approach consists of grouping variables into ‘modules’, each of which is then allocated to one or more ‘instruments’. Each instrument is then administered to a random sample of population units, and each sample unit responds to all modules of the instrument. This approach offers a way of designing a system of integrated social surveys that balances the need to limit the cost and the need to obtain sufficient information. The allocation of the modules to instruments draws on the methodology of split questionnaire designs. The composition of the instruments, that is, how the modules are allocated to instruments, and the corresponding sample sizes are obtained as a solution to an optimisation problem. This optimisation involves minimisation of respondent burden and data collection cost, while respecting certain design constraints usually encountered in practice. These constraints may include, for example, the level of precision required and dependencies between the variables. We propose using a random search algorithm to find approximate optimal solutions to this problem. The algorithm is proved to fulfil conditions that ensure convergence to the global optimum and can also produce an efficient design for a split questionnaire.","","","",""

A recent survey has established that the statisticians in the European Statistical System dealing with the maintenance and development of national Statistical Business Registers find useful that they can find in the Manual the information necessary to allow the correct and consistent interpretation of the Regulation and recommendations on best practices of various countries in building and operating registers and in treatment of special cases. Users also appreciate that each chapter is capable of being read separately, whilst still forming part of a coherent set. The EU Regulation also legislates on the exchange of confidential data. This was the pillar on which was built the EuroGroups Register of multinational enterprise groups, managed by Eurostat with the participation of all European countries. A revision of the Manual will be necessary, in order to take on board the provisions of the upcoming new Regulation, as well as some new recommendations originated by the on-going Data Quality Programme for the Statistical Business Registers in the European Statistical System.","","","",""

The data come from a unique dataset provided by the ESSLait Project on Linking Microdata, which contains internationally comparable data based on the production statistics linked at firm level with the novel ICT usage indicators. We adopt a standard conditional labour demand model and control for unobservable time-invariant firm-specific effects. The results show that ICT use has a statistically insignificant labour substitution effect and this effect is robust across countries, sectors and measures of ICT use. Our findings suggest that increased use of ICT within firms does not reduce the numbers of workers they employ.","","","",""

The components' density estimates are obtained from a medium-size dynamic factor model handling mixed frequencies of observation and ragged-edged data structures. They reflect both parameter and filtering uncertainty and are obtained by implementing a bootstrap algorithm for simulating from the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimators of the model parameters, and conditional simulation filters for simulating from the predictive distribution of GDP. Both algorithms process the data sequentially as they become available in real time. The GDP density estimates for the output and expenditure approach are combined using alternative weighting schemes and evaluated with different tests based on the probability integral transform and by applying scoring rules.","","","",""

It is a system for monitoring economic policies and detecting potential harms to the proper functioning of the economy of a Member State, of the Economic and Monetary Union, and of the European Union as a whole. The MIP is supported by the analysis of a set of headline and auxiliary indicators, whose data coverage can reach twenty years due to data transformations. In order to ensure the necessary time series length for policy makers, statisticians can resort to statistical techniques such as back-calculation. This paper illustrates the MIP in the European Union policy context and some applications of back-calculation to two MIP indicators.","","","",""

To design and monitor effective policy, good-quality data are indispensable. Production and consumption are two sides of the same coin, and in today's globalized world, an integrated and consistent inter-country accounting framework that links these two is a necessity for adequate analysis. A better understanding of global value chains starts with capturing production and trade relations in a coherent and complete system. More insight in the environmental impact of consumption requires an integrated environmental-economic accounting framework. Although producers generally are the ones to pay the wages, extract the resources, and emit the greenhouse gases - our productive system is in place to serve our consumer society. More awareness of the impact of consumption, at home and abroad, is needed to change our behaviour and create a sustainable economy.","","","",""

However, can these tables be reasonably converted to a different classification of industries and products using aggregate information? We develop a conversion method that allows changes in classification that are independent of the number of industries and products. In addition, we provide evidence about its empirical performance compared with projection methods. We find projection methods perform better than conversion methods, at least when using aggregate information. Nonetheless, unlike conversion methods, projection methods generally require supply, use and input/output tables in the new classification that might not always be available. In their absence, we recommend using more detailed and sophisticated data.","","","",""

This paper examines a selection of estimation methods applied to the European context where the analysts are not in possession of superior data. The estimation methods are restricted to the use of automated methods that would require more than just the row and column sums of the tables (as in projections) but less than a combination of various conflicting information (as in compilation). The results are assessed against the official Supply, Use and Input-Output tables of Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Finland, Austria and Slovakia by using matrix difference metrics. The main conclusion is that using the structures of previous years usually performs better than any other approach.","","","",""

Traditional data sources, namely survey and administrative data, represent nowadays a valuable but small portion of the global data stock, much thereof being held in the private sector. The availability of new data sources is only one aspect of the global change that concerns official statistics. Other aspects, more subtle but not less important, include the changes in perceptions, expectations, behaviours and relations between the stakeholders. The environment around official statistics has changed: statistical offices are not any more data monopolists, but one prominent species among many others in a larger (and complex) ecosystem. What was established in the traditional world of legacy data sources (in terms of regulations, technologies, practices, etc.) is not guaranteed to be sufficient any more with new data sources. Trusted Smart Statistics is not about replacing existing sources and processes, but augmenting them with new ones. Such augmentation however will not be only incremental: the path towards Trusted Smart Statistics is not about tweaking some components of the legacy system but about building an entirely new system that will coexist with the legacy one. In this position paper we outline some key design principles for the new Trusted Smart Statistics system. Taken collectively they picture a system where the smart and trust aspects enable and reinforce each other. A system that is more extrovert towards external stakeholders (citizens, private companies, public authorities) with whom Statistical Offices will be sharing computation, control, code, logs and of course final statistics, without necessarily sharing the raw input data.

However, multiple problems and uncertainties need to be solved before these data can inform, support or even become an integral part of statistical production processes. In this article, we focus on arguably the most important problem hindering the application of mobile phone data in official statistics: Detecting home locations. We argue that current efforts to detect home locations suffer from a blind deployment of criteria to define a place of residence and from limited validation possibilities. We support our argument by analysing the performance of five home detection algorithms (HDAs) that have been applied to a large, French, Call Detailed Record (CDR) data set (~18 million users, five months). Our results show that criteria choice in HDAs influences the detection of home locations for up to about 40% of users, that HDAs perform poorly when compared with a validation data set (resulting in 358-gap), and that their performance is sensitive to the time period and the duration of observation. Based on our findings and experiences, we offer several recommendations for official statistics. If adopted, our recommendations would help ensure more reliable use of mobile phone data vis-à-vis official statistics.","","","",""

The Action Plan identifies short, medium and long term objectives aiming at integrating big data sources into the production of European Statistics. The BIGD project makes part of the ESS Vision 2020 for modernising European Statistics. Pilots that investigate the potential of selected big data sources for European Statistics constitute the core part of the BIGD project. The pilots are conducted by a consortium of national statistical institutes, so called ESSnets, which are co-financed by the European Commission. The pilots are backed by a number of cross-cutting activities that analyse conditions of using big data by statistical institutes, such as analysis of the legal situation, ethical principles, skills and competences, and communication. The ESSnet started working in 2016, activities will terminate in 2019. The long term objective of the Big Data Action Plan and Roadmap is integrating big data into the portfolio of European Statistics. The ESS is closely collaborating with initiatives at UN level and with data for policy initiatives at the European Commission.","","","",""
